# Deforestation

This is a **SQL**-based project which focuses on the issue of deforestation. This
project is part of the Udacity "SQL" nanodegree program. This repo consists
of the actual **SQL** code that is used for the project and the written **Report**
that is to be submitted, which contains all the **SQL** code as an _Appendix_.

## Project Information
This is basically a simplified data analytics project which focuses on using
**SQL** to analyse, manipulate and view data dealing with the issue of
deforestation. This project consists of the **SQL** code used as queries to
obtain the relevant data, and a written report where the data was used to provide
feedback and analysis on deforestation.

Briefly, I had to pretend that I was a data analyst working for a non-profit
organisation which focuses on deforestation on a global, regional and country
level basis. I had to write up a report for the organisation, and to write the
report, I needed to use **SQL** to retrieve the data that was required as per
the project instructions.
